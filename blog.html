            <p10>The computer information technology course is designed to combine the benefits of a traditional college education with the benefits of hands-on training in state-of-the-art computer technology. Students become technically competent, but also learn to write well-organized and clear memos and reports.
                The Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) program prepares students to be IT professionals who are able to perform installation, operation, development, maintenance and administration of computer applications.
